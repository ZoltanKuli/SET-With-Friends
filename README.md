# The Story Behind SET With Friends

I made SET With Friends during the fall of 2020 for my second web development class.

This was my biggest JavaScript project yet, and I was still just learning the language.

However, in the end, the game turned out great. 

It is enjoyable to play, the code functions as intended, and it even has a nice look.

What's more, it works on different screen sizes and resolutions.
